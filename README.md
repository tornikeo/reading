# Tornikeo's reading list

I store papers (when possible) and personal notes on said papers, in markdown format. For now, each paper gets own directory, i.e. [Recipes for Pre-training LLMs with MXFP8](./Recipes%20for%20Pre-training%20LLMs%20with%20MXFP8/).

Feel free to point out mistakes in notes! :)
